            <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

            <!-- Good Website: Discovery Place -->
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://discoveryplace.org/" target="_blank">Discovery Place</a></h3>
                <p>This is the website for Discovery Place, a science museum in Charlotte, NC, offering interactive exhibits and educational experiences. It uses a clean, modern design with a light blue, white, and gray color scheme.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site effectively uses contrast with a light background and darker text, complemented by light blue accents that draw attention to key areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Design elements like centered sections and consistent typography are repeated throughout, creating a cohesive look.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is center-aligned, giving it a clean and organized appearance, though the dual headers can be slightly confusing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is well-spaced and grouped, though the scrolling animation sometimes lags behind the user’s scroll speed.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Bad Website: Yale Art -->
            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
                <p>This is the website for Yale’s School of Art, intended to showcase student work and program details, but it’s chaotic and hard to navigate due to poor design choices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Random colors (green, yellow, black) clash with the grid-patterned chair background, making it hard to read or focus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There’s no consistent design—colors, fonts, and layouts feel arbitrary with no unifying theme.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is left-aligned with no clear structure, leading to a cluttered and unbalanced look.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Information is poorly grouped, links are broken, and the layout feels chaotic due to unrestricted editing by students.</li>
                </ul>
